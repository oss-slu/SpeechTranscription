#The 'nltk' library installation is more complex than just doing 'pip install nltk'.
#This guide will show you how to install the 'nltk' library on different opertating systems (OS).
#
#MacOS: 
#
#    Perform the following steps to install nltk on MacOS. Do not include apostrophe's ( ' ' ) in command line:
#
#        1. Install nltk and ceertifi via pip:
#            'pip install nltk'
#            'pip3 install certifi'  
#
#        2. Open Python Interpreter and import/download nltk:
#            'python'
#            >>> 'import nltk'
#            >>> 'nltk.download()'' 
#
#        3. Enter to following commands to avoid SSL Certificate issues:
#            'CERT_PATH=$(python -m certifi)'
#            'export SSL_CERT_FILE=${CERT_PATH}'
#            'export REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=${CERT_PATH}'
#
#    The nltk library should now be ready to use on MacOS.
#    
#    However, this is only a temporary fix for your current terminal session.
#    
#    In order to permanently fix this problem, you must add the previous 3 lines (from the temporary fix) to your .bash_profile.
#
#
#
#Windows & Linux:
#
#    - 'pip install nltk'
#    - 'import nltk'
#    - 'nltk.download()'
#    - Then click on the identifier 'all', then click 'Download'
